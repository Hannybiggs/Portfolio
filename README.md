# Portfolio

This project was undertaken to create a webpage that showcases my personal work, be it personal business ventures or programming related projects.
It was created from scratch and employs simple HTML and CSS properties. HTML was done as semantically as possible, and CSS was organized via appearance as is custom.
Some CSS elements in particular were added to make the website more dynamic an dinteractive. 
Some examples of CSS points of attention are listed below.

## CSS elements:
-Hover cusor and glow on navigation elements at top of page
-Hover cusor and glow on footer "contact me" elements
-Opacity and glow on project images upon hover
-Text of project name appears when you hover on projects
-Flexbox CSS properties for more interesting layout design
-CSS float for some images 

## Contact Me section: 
-Link to external Github account
-Link to external LinkedIn profile
-Connection to mail application for email contact
 
 ## Results
The results of this project are the creation of a basic portfolio page. I was able too experiment with colors, styles, etc. to create a coheasive webpage.

## Goals for the future
As my portfolio expands I would like to revisit this project and create more interesting elements in the webpage. I will be adding more content in terms of text as well as creating subpages to connecting project pages as my portfolio expands.
